# ML Energy Efficiency

This repository contains solutions for two projects in the course 02450 - Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining, at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The project consists of two parts. <br/>

### Data:
The data used for both parts is the [Energy Efficiency Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/eergy-efficiency-dataset):<br/>
**Source:** The dataset was created by Angeliki Xifara (angxifara@gmail.com, Civil/Structural Engineer) and was processed by Athanasios Tsanas (tsanasthanasis@gmail.com, Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, University of Oxford, UK).<br/>
**Information about the data from the creators:** We perform energy analysis using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to predict two real valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.<br/>

### Part 1:
The theme of the first part is *Feature extraction and data visualization*. This includes summary statistics and description of the dataset, distributions of the data, feature-response relations, correlations and a part on principal component analysis. 

### Part 2:
The theme of the second part is *Supervised learning: Regression and classification*. Our goal was to predict two different responses, both with regression and classification, and statistically evaluate the results. Some techniques used: Linear regression, Logistic regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Multinomial regression, K-nearest neighbors. For validation: Two-level cross-validation, McNemar's test, hypothesis testing, p-values.
